# Ahungry Deletefier

NOTE: Alpha quality, I need to do some play throughs with this mod!

WARNING: You will NOT be able to complete certain quests as expected
with this mod.  Accepting that will (perhaps) add some replayability -
or let CLUAConsole be your friend for items you feel you should have
received (use NearInfinity or EEKeeper on another saved game to find
the item codes).

This is also probably going to do really dumb things, like remove
"creature" items off of creatures (where some creature abilities are
stored/tracked by item codes like GHOULC.itm, or the troll thing SCS
does?).

What percent of items would you like to have disappear (creatures,
stores, and areas)?

   0   = no items deleted (why are you installing this mod again?)
   50  = half of all items are deleted
   100 = all items are deleted that aren't script creations/random npc loot (probably a bad idea!)

Hint: On a megamod (200+ mods) I enjoy 90 to 95 - it makes gear
acquisition exciting again.

BG:EE/BG2:EE/EET mod - Removes many items from
creatures/stores/areas - basically tries to 'downgrade' any special
item types into their base form given some probability.

I would recommend installing this last, or at least after all mods
that update/add files in override/

# TODO

I would like to explicitly re-add (or skip removal of) quest items
which aren't exciting to have removed (and pretty much break another
mod if not present) - things like Magic Store of Vergadan and other
fun mods that are heavily item driven.  I probably just need to find
the related mod prefixes.  The trick is that some mods (ones with tons
of +3/+4 weapons in bg1) should have most their items obliterated (to
keep things exciting).
