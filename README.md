# Ahungry Deletefier

BG:EE/BG2:EE/EET mod - Removes many items from
creatures/stores/areas - basically tries to 'downgrade' any special
item types into their base form given some probability.

I would recommend installing this last, or at least after all mods
that update/add .cre files in override/

## Install

```
weinstall ahungry_deletefier
```

## Uninstall

```
weinstall ahungry_deletefier --uninstall
```
